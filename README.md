SOLUTION : a tourist place recommender system for rajasthan tourism website using machine learning .This system will help in enhancing the experience of tourists and also search for a sequence of items to do given within a given time.


BRIEF IDEA : This recommender system will work as follows-

  >> If you had visited some places and you liked these places and given positive feedbacks or reviews. On the basis of what you have visited in your past and what you like/dislike, the system will predict the next best destination according to you. Also it will see the reviews and feedbacks of all the users that have already visited the places and then it will recommend you.

  >> This recommender system will also search for a coherent sequence of  items to do given the time constraint . For example â€“ You are travelling somewhere and after your meeting you have got three-four hours before your flight back. Where can you visit in those hours? Well in that case, you can use this recommender system without giving a second thought, it will suggest you the best.
